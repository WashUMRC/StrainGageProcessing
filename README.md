# StrainGaugeProcessing

This script will walk you through analyzing strain gauge data collected through the dynamight. 

> Inputs - both force and strain files for each mouse where force data is the third column of force files, strain data is the second column of strain files, and strain time is the first column of strain files. A number of editable parameters required for converting strain voltages to strain are at the top of the file. You are expected to have all relevant files for a single mouse in a folder, so that number of ice when prompted will refer to the number of folders you'll need to access.

> Outputs - text file with mins and maxes of stress and strain, matched to the order of your input files.
